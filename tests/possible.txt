Possible enhancements / frustrations

1. parseCSV currently cannot group content that are wrapped in quotation marks
    so "hello, my name is" will become ["hello,] [my name is"]. It also doesn't understand
    that the double quotes are supposed to wrap the content. AKA the deliminator is only 
    ',' which limits the ways this parseCSV can be used.

2. It only returns in string, meaning I would have to convert the data into appropriate
    types manually which is annoying. It would be convenient for it to be able to convert
    specific fields into specific data types before handing it over to me, so that I don't
    have to worry about that after.

3. It currently has no safeguarding to csv files that have bad structure (missing columns,
    for example).

4. Similarly, it does not check whether the data in the csv file corresponds to what the
    user might expect, as shown with "expect(results[2]).toEqual(["Bob", "thirty"])" in 
    the basic parser test file.

    Like #2, it might be beneficial to allow users to input what types they are expecting
    and inform them if the data is not that type or convert it accordingly.
